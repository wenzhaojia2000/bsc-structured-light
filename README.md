# `bsc-structured-light`

This is an edited version of *"Computational and Theoretical Analysis of Structured Light: Quadrupole Interactions in Chiral Molecules"*, a thesis submitted as part of a project in the final year in my degree in BSc Physics. Some names were edited out to protect their privacy. The project consists of two parts:

+ The report and presentation are stored in the `report/` directory.
    + In order to compile `report.tex`, a LuaLaTeX or XeTeX engine is required as it depends on `unicode-math`.
    + `presentation.pptx` contains CMU Serif and CMU Sans-serif fonts ([Download link](https://cm-unicode.sourceforge.io/download.html)). Without these, the presentation may look strange.
+ Code is stored in the `src/` directory. Certain images in the report (`report/svg`) were generated in the main function of `visualise.py`.
    + Some lines of code represent complex equations, which you can look up in the report.
